Cars from Audi Aktiengesellschaft, better known worldwide as Audi AG Germany,<br> have been available in India since 2004. 
Entire cars had to<br> be imported at that time due to the lack of an assembling facility in the country.<br>
Prices soared due to heavy import duty. Taking the growing <br>interest in its cars as a sign, Audi decided to jump full-fledged
into the Indian car market,<br> using the Skoda Auto India Private Limited manufacturing facilities in Aurangabad, Maharashtra, 
thus giving birth to Audi India in March<br> 2007 as a subsidiary of Volkswagen sales group. Audi AG had already been a majority
(99.5%) owned subsidiary of Volkswagen AG since 1966.<br>
Audi Dealers  Audi Car Models  At present <br>Audi offers 9 models in India and they are Audi A4, Audi A6, Audi Q5, Audi Q7,
Audi A8, Audi R8 and Audi TT. The Ex-showroom<br> price of Audi cars in India starts from Rs.2850000 for the A4 model to over 
Rs. 11639000 for the Audi R8 model. They have been assembling the A4 <br>and the A6 at the Aurangabad plant since 2007. 
Recently, the Q5 was also added to the assembly line,<br> thus making a total of three models that are assembled in India 
while the others are imported on demand. <br>
At present Audi India has 31 dealers in 13 states.<br> Get complete information on Audi car prices in India and also <br>compare
